# TCAD - templated 3D CAD as simple as any STL

- (1) As simple as both STLs, the standard template library and stereolithography
- (2) All at your fingertips, no objs, libs, millions of dlls
- (3) Easy debugging
- (4) Free to change

The plan :
- point (done)
- curves (done)
- surfaces (next)
- volumes
- FFD
- intersections, maybe implicit
- implicit or b-rep booleans

Point
=====
  tpoint.h              - 3-dimensional vector (0 parametric dimensions) point with ariphmetic operations

Curves
======

Curves of various kinds, parametric, dependent of one parameter U.

Files<br /><br />

- toperations.h - highest level, simplest in use
- tbasecurve.h  - high level, more details, abstract class
- curves themselves (details)
    tlsqsegment         - low-power poly generated by plain LSQ
    torthosegment       - segment based on Jacobi ortho poly
    tbeziersegment      - Bezier segment
    tbeziercurve        - Bezier curve (collection of Bezier segments)
    tpointcurve         - piecewise linear curve of points
    tsplinecurve        - B-spline curve

Example code how to use<br /><br />

main.cpp, see examples 1.1 .. 1.12 : how to use curves, like create, smooth, intersect, order points etc.
<B>Important : set DEBUG_DIR for output of debug CAD files.</B>
