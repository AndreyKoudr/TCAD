# TCAD - templated 3D CAD

- (1) As simple as both STLs, the Standard Template Library or STereoLithography
- (2) All at your fingertips, no objs, libs, millions of dlls
- (3) Easy debugging
- (4) Free to change

The plan :
- point (done)
- curves (done)
- surfaces (doing)
- volumes
- blocks
- FFD
- intersections, maybe implicit
- booleans, maybe implicit
- 3D mesh generation
- finite elements

Point
=====
  tpoint.h                  - 3-dimensional vector (0 parametric dimensions) point with ariphmetic operations

Curves
======

Curves of various kinds, parametric, dependent of one parameter U.

<B>Files</B><br />

- toperations.h - highest level, simplest in use
- tbasecurve.h  - high level, more details, abstract class
- curves themselves (detailed)
    - tlsqsegment.h         - low-power poly generated by plain LSQ
    - torthosegment.h       - segment based on Jacobi ortho poly
    - tbeziersegment.h      - Bezier segment
    - tbeziercurve.h        - Bezier curve (collection of Bezier segments)
    - tpointcurve.h         - piecewise linear curve of points
    - tsplinecurve.h        - B-spline curve

<B>Example code how to use</B><br />

main.cpp, see examples 1.1 .. 1.12 : how to use curves, like create, smooth, intersect, order points etc.<br />
<B>Important : set DEBUG_DIR for place to output of debug CAD files.</B>
