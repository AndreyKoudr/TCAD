# TCAD - templated 3D CAD

- (1) As simple as both STLs, the Standard Template Library or STereoLithography
- (2) All in front of you, no objs, libs, millions of dlls
- (3) Simple, mostly one-line code
- (4) Easy debugging, heavily commented
- (5) Free to change

The plan :
- point (done)
- curves (done)
- surfaces (<B>doing... a week-two</B>)

<B>to do</B>
- volumes
- blocks
- FFD
- intersections, maybe implicit
- booleans, maybe implicit
- 3D mesh
- level sets
- finite elements
- GUI?

Point
=====
  tpoint.h                  - 3-dimensional vector (0 parametric dimensions) point with ariphmetic operations

Curves
======

Curves of various kinds, parametric, dependent of one parameter U. Most operations are linearised. 
Some operations are some n-squared (yet).

<B>Files</B><br />

- toperations.h - highest level, simplest in use
- tbasecurve.h  - high level, more details, abstract class
- curves themselves (detailed)
    - tlsqsegment.h         - low-power poly generated by plain LSQ
    - torthosegment.h       - segment based on Jacobi ortho poly
    - tbeziersegment.h      - Bezier segment
    - tbeziercurve.h        - Bezier curve (collection of Bezier segments)
    - tpointcurve.h         - piecewise linear curve of points
    - tsplinecurve.h        - B-spline curve

<B>Example code how to use</B><br />

main.cpp, see examples on how to use curves, like create, smooth, intersect, order points etc.<br />
<B>Important : set DEBUG_DIR for place to output of debug CAD files.</B>

- 1.1 Curves : how to exclude neighbour duplicate nodes
- 1.2 Curves : compare original points and low-power LSQ segment, do not expecta good correspondence - 
  the lsq is a simple poly of power 3
- 1.3 Curves : compare points and Bezier segment, do not expect a good correspondence - Bezier segment is qubic
- 1.4 Curves : compare points and segment of orthogonal polynomials of degree 4. Starting END_ROUNDED 
  end is set to handle the round LE.
- 1.5 Curves : compare points and Bezier curve (collection of Bezier segments).
- 1.6 Curves : compare points and approximated b-spline.
- 1.7 Curves : compare points and approximated b-spline with less number of control points (10 here).
- 1.8 Curves : how to smooth a curve (curve2 below) with various approximants.
- 1.9 Curves : how to diminish effect of smoothing near curve ends (much needed when handling surface control points)
- 1.10 Curves : how to find parameter U for a point on curve.
- 1.11 Curves : how to intersect by plane.
- 1.12 Curves : how to intersect two curves.
- 1.13 Curves : cut a piece of curve from the previous example
- 1.14 Curves : order unordered points.


Surfaces
========

<B>Example code how to use</B><br />

- 2.1 Surfaces : triangles : save in STL
- 2.2 Surfaces : triangles : manifold? solid?
- 2.3 Surfaces : triangles : cut by plane
- 2.4 Surfaces : triangles : how to find a sharpest point in intersection curve
- 2.5 Surfaces : triangles : how to get triangulation boundary
- 2.6 Surfaces : triangles : more complicated cases, load STL, check if manifold and solid, generate boundary and cut by plane


Traingles are ready, doing Coons, Bezier and spline surfaces ...
